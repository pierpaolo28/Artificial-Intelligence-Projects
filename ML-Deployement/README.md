# ML-Model-Deployment
## Deployment of a trained Machine Learning model on a web app, ready to make predictions in the real world.

The model was created using python pandas and sklearn libraries and was then stored to be ready to make predictions using pickle.
Using flask has then been possible to create a web app which includes an HTML,CSS and Javascript interface to improve the design. <br>

It has then been possible to deploy this model online using Heroku. <br>

This web app is also available in my personal website and at this 
[link](https://pierpaolo28.github.io/Projects/flask.html). <br> 

In order to create this repository I followed many tutorials and guides such as: <br>
